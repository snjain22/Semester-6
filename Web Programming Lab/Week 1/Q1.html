    <h1>
        Life's Madness
    </h1>
    Life gets faster <b> everyday, </b>
    <br>
    No time to think, no time to <b> play. </b>
    <br>
    Hurry, chaos, lots of <b> stress; </b>
    <br>
    Tension leads to <b> sleeplessness. </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    When will all this madness <b> cease? </b>
    <br>
    Where is free time? Where is <b> peace? </b>
    <br>
    I'm running, doing, till I <b> drop </b>. </b>
    <br>
    Give me my buttons; Paise. Mute. <b> STOP! </b>
